Instructions:
````bash
git clone http://github.com/amirkdv/dotfiles.git
dotfiles/install
````
The `install` script will install the dotfiles for the user who runs the script.
It also assumes that `wget` is installed and that the current user, if not
`root`, has `sudo` privileges (and that, of course, `sudo` is installed).
